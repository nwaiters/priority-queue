# Priority Queue (Min-Heap Implementation)

## Overview
This project implements a dynamic priority queue using a min-heap data structure in C++. It supports efficient insertion, retrieval of the minimum value, and extraction of the minimum while maintaining the heap property throughout.

## Features
- Insert integers into the priority queue
- Retrieve the current minimum value (`min()`)
- Extract and remove the minimum element (`extractMin()`)
- Maintain heap structure with `heapify`
- Dynamic array allocation with manual memory management
- Index-based parent and child navigation

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Command-line interface
